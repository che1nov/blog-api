# Blogging Platform API

This project is a simple RESTful API for a personal blogging platform built with Go. It demonstrates basic CRUD operations for blog posts, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts.

## Goals

The goals of this project are to help you:
- Understand what RESTful APIs are, including best practices and conventions.
- Learn how to create a RESTful API.
- Learn about common HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
- Learn about status codes and error handling in APIs.
- Learn how to perform CRUD operations using an API.
- Learn how to work with databases.

## Requirements

The API allows users to perform the following operations:
- Create a new blog post.
- Update an existing blog post.
- Delete an existing blog post.
- Get a single blog post.
- Get all blog posts.
- Filter blog posts by a search term.

## API Endpoints

### Create Blog Post

Create a new blog post using the POST method.

```
POST /posts
{
  "title": "My First Blog Post",
  "content": "This is the content of my first blog post.",
  "category": "Technology",
  "tags": ["Tech", "Programming"]
}
```

Each blog post should have the following fields:

```
{
  "title": "My First Blog Post",
  "content": "This is the content of my first blog post.",
  "category": "Technology",
  "tags": ["Tech", "Programming"]
}
```

The endpoint should validate the request body and return a 201 Created status code with the newly created blog post, or a 400 Bad Request status code with error messages in case of validation errors.

### Update Blog Post

Update an existing blog post using the PUT method.

```
PUT /posts/{id}
{
  "title": "My Updated Blog Post",
  "content": "This is the updated content of my first blog post.",
  "category": "Technology",
  "tags": ["Tech", "Programming"]
}
```

The endpoint should validate the request body and return a 200 OK status code with the updated blog post, or a 400 Bad Request status code with error messages in case of validation errors. It should return a 404 Not Found status code if the blog post was not found.

### Delete Blog Post

Delete an existing blog post using the DELETE method.

```
DELETE /posts/{id}
```

The endpoint should return a 204 No Content status code if the blog post was successfully deleted, or a 404 Not Found status code if the blog post was not found.

### Get Blog Post

Get a single blog post using the GET method.

```
GET /posts/{id}
```

The endpoint should return a 200 OK status code with the blog post, or a 404 Not Found status code if the blog post was not found.

### Get All Blog Posts

Get all blog posts using the GET method.

```
GET /posts
```

The endpoint should return a 200 OK status code with an array of blog posts. You donâ€™t have to implement pagination, authentication, or authorization for this project. You can focus on the core functionality of the API.

### Filter Blog Posts

Filter blog posts by a search term using the GET method.

```
GET /posts?term={searchTerm}
```

This should return all blog posts that have the term in their title, content, or category. You can use a simple SQL query if you are using a SQL database or a similar query for a NoSQL database.
